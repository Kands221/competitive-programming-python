# ðŸ“– Roadmap for Competitive Programming (Python + Codewars)

This file outlines my learning journey step by step.

## Stage 1: Python Foundations
- Variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- Data types (strings, lists, sets, dicts)
- Input/Output practice
- Basic math (mod, gcd/lcm)

## Stage 2: Problem-Solving Patterns
- Brute force vs optimized
- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Prefix sums
- Hash maps & sets

## Stage 3: Data Structures & Algorithms
- Sorting & searching
- Recursion & backtracking
- Stacks, queues, linked lists
- Trees and traversals

## Stage 4: Number Theory
- Primes & sieve
- Modular arithmetic
- Combinatorics
- Bitwise tricks

## Stage 5: Dynamic Programming
- 1D DP (Fibonacci, coin change)
- 2D DP (LCS, knapsack)
- Optimization techniques

## Stage 6: Graphs
- BFS, DFS
- Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- MST (Kruskal, Prim)
- Topological sort

## Stage 7: Advanced Topics
- String algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp)
- Segment trees, Fenwick trees
- Union-Find
- Geometry basics
- Advanced DP

âœ… As I progress, I will check off completed stages here.
